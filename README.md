### Content

* Pigeon: Small flying animals that can be found in forest biomes. They will follow the player if he is holding a wheat seed in his hand.
* Pigeon Coop: The "home" for the pigeon. A pigeon needs to be bound to it by feeding the pigeon one wheat seed while standing near the pigeon coop. Also the pigeon coop needs to contain at least 10 wheat seeds to bind the pigeon. After binding a pigeon can be send to any mail receptor in the world by choosing the wanted mail receptor in the pigeon coop screen. Available mail receptors can be filtered by typing the name into the search bar above. All items in the pigeon coop inventory are being send with the pigeon. Sending a pigeon costs one wheat seed for every 24 blocks in distance, with a minimum of 5 and maximum of 32 seeds.
* Mail Receptor: The block a pigeon can be sent to. When placing it the player can enter a name for it.

### Content

* Pigeon: Small flying animals that can be found in forest biomes. They will follow the player if he is holding a wheat seed in his hand.
* Pigeon Coop: The "home" for the pigeon. A pigeon needs to be bound to it by feeding the pigeon one wheat seed while standing near the pigeon coop. Also the pigeon coop needs to contain at least 10 wheat seeds to bind the pigeon. After binding a pigeon can be send to any mail receptor in the world by typing the name in the text field in the pigeon coop screen and clicking "Send Pigeon". All items in the pigeon coop inventory are being send with the pigeon. Sending a pigeon costs 25 wheat seeds.
* Mail Receptor: The block a pigeon can be sent to. When placing it the player can enter a name for it.
